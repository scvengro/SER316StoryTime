I would love to live in raesfeld
Harry always drives to work in his Porsche
Because he wanted to be the first to get the Apfelkuchen at the office! 🍎🍰🏢
However, sometimes he worries he might not be able to fit into his lederhosen... 👖😟
To ease this worry, he decided to wear a Dirndel so that he can eat all the Apfelkuchen his heart desires!

On his walk from the parking lot to the office building, Harry noticed a hund was following him.
